      <h2>Venue</h2>
      <p>Join us at our beautiful venue in Tielmes.</p>
      <p>We'll be celebrating at the "Casa Rural Vega de Tielmes"</p>
      <p>Calle de Cercado, 28550, Tielmes, Madrid</p>
      <p>It's the first house to the left at the bottom of the hill. You won't miss it.</p>
      <h2>Getting there</h2>
      <p>Madrid is a wonderful city with very modern public transit. 
        If you choose to stay in the city then you can get most of the way by taking Line 9 of the metro to Arganda del Rey.
        However, since we're getting married in a "casa rural" or rural bed and breakfast it's admittedly a bit out of the way.
      Once you get to Arganda, you can take the <strong>327 bus</strong> to the center of Tielmes which will leave you ten minutes away walking.
    Alternately, Spain has both Uber and Taxis which you can hail from either Arganda for a reduced fare, or all the way from Madrid as we're only about 30 minutes away from the city center.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Finally, if neither a cab nor Uber are up your alley and you simply want to explore more of the Spanish countryside, then renting a car is a great option!</p>

      <img src="images/parking.jpeg" alt="parking" class="schedule-img"/>
      <p>If taking this final choice you'll be here in no time and we have plenty of parking. We've mapped out where to park for you.</p>
      <ul><li>In the blue zone there are more spaces and greater availability</li>
      <li>The green zone has more traffic but you can park anywhere in that area.</li>
      <br>
        <em> A final note: </em><strong>Please leave spaces closest to the venue for those with reduced mobility or above the age of 65.</strong>
    </ul>

      <h1>Madrid</h1>
      <p>Madrid is only a half hour away by car!</p>
      <p>So why not see the city?!
        Explore the Plaza Mayor, The Rastro, or get your art on at the Prado and Thyssen.
        See some Flamenco, eat at Mercado San Miguel, and live the life castiza. 
        Madrid is the wonderful city where Austin and Paula first met having copas in the Plaza de la Paja.
      Why not retrace their steps?</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When do I have to RSVP by:<br></strong>July 15th<br> If you need more time please reach out to us individually. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Food allergies:</strong><br>Please let us know about any intolerances or allergies via the QR code on the invitation or the link we sent you.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Who is invited to the wedding?</strong><br>Due to the limited capacity of the venue, only those named on the invitation are invited. <em>(Austin has learned that marrying into a Spanish family means he now has a very big family)</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Weather:</strong><br>The wedding will take place outdoors. Since it’s early September, it will most likely be warm, with temperatures between 25–30°C (77-88˚F). We recommend sunscreen and, if you like, a stylish hat. We'd also recommend a light jacket for the later evening as it can get down to 15˚C (59˚F).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>What’s on the menu?</strong><br>We'll have tapas to start, and then move on to three types of Paella. Dessert is a surprise.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Is there a gift list or registry?</strong><br>No, but if you’d like to contribute to our honeymoon, we’ve set up a Paypal in the invitation.
        Alternately, feel free to reach out and ask, though anything you wish to give will be appreciated.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Will people sitting near me speak my language?</strong><br>Fret not, we'll make sure that everyone has someone to talk to.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Still have questions?</strong><br>Feel free to email us at: paulayaustin @ gmail.com <br>
        <em>Note, to actually use this email remove the spaces. <br>The format above just keeps us from getting spammed by bots</em></li>
      
      <br><br>
  <h1>Dress code: Cocktail attire</h1>
  <p><em>What is cocktail attire? We asked the internet so you don’t have to:</em><p></p>   
  <p>
    Cocktail attire is the sweet spot between “fancy” and “please don’t make me wear a tux.” 
    It’s perfect for daytime weddings or outdoor events where you want to look sharp and still breathe.
    <br>
  <p><strong>In summary: Dress to impress, but don’t stress.</strong><p>
  </p>
  <h3>Men (Caballeros)</h3>
  <br>
  <p>A suit works great, but a dress shirt with nice trousers and a blazer also does the trick. Ties or bowties? Totally optional—feel free to go bold with colors or patterns if you’re feeling festive. And yes, you can ditch the jacket once the dancing starts.</p>
  <h3>Women (Damas)</h3>
  <p>Short, midi, or long dresses are all fair game. Skirts, blouses, or chic trousers? Absolutely. Heels are welcome (but not required—we love a comfy queen), and accessories should say <em>elegant guest</em>, not <em>I stole this from a red carpet.</em></p>

      <h2>Minions</h2>
      <h2>(The wedding party)</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Through the years we’ve collected good friends from all walks of life and places near and far. 
        In Austin’s case very far – in Paula’s very near. 
        Still, whether close or far, these folks are exceptionally close to our hearts and we’ll be relying on them throughout the nuptials to not only give a speech or two, but to also help things run smoothly. 
        The least we can do is to tell you about them. One thing you might note, is that they are all maids of honor, and they’re all the best men in plural. 
        We couldn’t rank them as they all have helped us along the way in different ways that each deserve their own recognition. </p>
      <div class="party-grid">
        <div class="party-column">

          <h3>The Best Men</h3>
          <div class="party-item"><img src="images/bestmen/zack.jpeg" alt="Zack"/><p>Zack</p></div>
          <p>Zack may be the reason more than any other that you’re coming to this wedding. 
            He not only became one of our best friends in Paris, but also introduced Paula to the job which would bring her to Paris from Madrid, ending our long distance relationship in the best way possible. 
            In addition to his wit, you’ll find Zack’s empathy and charm will always be there for you. </p><br>
          <div class="party-item"><img src="images/bestmen/dimi.jpeg" alt="Dimi"/><p>Dimi</p></div>
          <p>Don’t do it… Don’t you dare sing here’s to brother Austin on my wedding day… 
            One of my best and closest friends who’s always been there to support me and now Paula. 
            Dimi and I met at the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity at the University of Vermont, and to this day you should not leave us alone with anything stronger than beer. 
            If the wedding turns to late night cooking though… you probably should not let either of us near the fryer. </p><br>
          <div class="party-item"><img src="images/bestmen/jamie.jpg" alt="Jamie"/><p>Jamie</p></div>
          <p>It’s not often you join a fraternity and end up with a sister as a brother but such is the case as to me she’ll always be a part of Alpha Gamma Rho. 
            If Dimi got me in trouble then Jamie is the one who’s always gotten me out of it.
            At the very least she made sure I made it to the next day. 
            Her energy and positivity are infectious, and her long island iced teas are dangerous. 
            Always the life of the part, ask her about what she’s reading too as she’ll always suggest something good. </p><br>
          <div class="party-item"><img src="images/bestmen/maxime.jpeg" alt="Maxime"/><p>Maxime</p></div>
          <p>There was a time when we were just two Guiris in Madrid. Maxime is similar to Zack in one way, and that is that he’s the first friend I made through Reddit. 
            In our time in Madrid we became thick as thieves, and for a time almost every weekend eating and drinking our way through the capital. What wonderful days. 
            Since then he’s gone to the US and I’ve stayed Europe bound, but to this I know I can count on him and vice versa.
            Is our friendship also founded on a mutual love of coffee? Possibly, but then that’s a good friend.</p><br>
          <div class="party-item"><img src="images/bestmen/alba.jpeg" alt="Alba"/><p>Alba</p></div>
          Alba is my Spanish Dimi… No one is more dangerous at party time. 
          Then again I’d like to think I’ve held my own but know deep down I haven’t. 
          Always there and dependable, she formed to me an integral part of the famed “cactus” whatsapp group. 
          If you know, you know. 
          Now based in Berlin, she’s here to protect me from Jamie’s long island iced teas by taking them for me.<br><br> 
          <div class="party-item"><img src="images/bestmen/guille.jpeg" alt="Guille"/><p>Guille</p></div>
          <p>Here is the part of the best men where I get to show off just how lucky I am.
             Paula’s brother Guille is now mine as well. 
             In the time we’ve known each other his graciousness and acceptance of me has given me another brother. 
             But then again, this is a surprise to no one who knows him or the family he comes from. 
             I could not have asked for a more welcoming group of in-laws. 
             But anyone who knows Guille through Beli and Alfonso knows that this is just the way the Fidalgo Sanchez-Casas have always been. 
             I count myself very lucky to have Guille as one of my best men. </p>
          <div class="party-item"><img src="images/bestmen/noah.jpeg" alt="Noah"/><p>Noah</p></div>
          
          <p>I didn’t get lucky once, but twice. 
            When Noah married my sister it means that I get to say I have not one, but two amazing brothers in law! 
            Noah is someone who gets things done and doesn’t mind the fuss and kerfuffle going on around him. 
            Reliant and exceptional, I love how well he takes care of Zoë.
            Knowing how responsible he is, I’m glad to know someone will keep me from falling into the pool on the night of the wedding.</p>

            <p>Tim was going to be a best man as well, but then I realized he’s the only captain I know so it seemed better to have him officiate. 
              Tim and I know each other from a time when I was actually in shape… and ran for fun believe it or not. 
              Now from the halls of University High School in Connecticut all the way to Madrid, he’s remained someone I can always depend on to cheer me up with amazing adventures through which I can live "vicariously".
            (See what I did there? He's the "vicar.") </p>
